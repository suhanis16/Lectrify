# Lectrify
Our team is working on creating a platform, centered around the powerful Protege Effect. 
Our website will offer users the opportunity to select a topic, level, and board of their choice, such as Mitochondria, 8th Grade, CBSE. 
With this information, the user will step into the role of a teacher, imparting knowledge and insights to an AI student. But it doesn't stop there. 
The AI student will be programmed to ask the user questions based on identified gaps in their knowledge. 
This interactive process will allow the user to engage with the material on a deeper level, reinforcing their understanding of the topic. 
To further enrich the learning experience, the AI student will take a test with an AI professor, providing valuable feedback to the user in the form of a report card. 
After this, the user can revisit the topic and reinforce their knowledge, honing their learning and teaching.
